This error occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceName` property on iOS devices. It often returns an empty string instead of the device's actual name. This can disrupt device-specific logic in your app.  The issue seems related to how Expo interacts with iOS's device naming mechanisms. This is inconsistent, as it might work on some iOS devices but not others, and might even intermittently provide results on a single device.
